# TechEducation - AI Powered Learning Platform

TechEducation is a modern AI-powered learning platform designed to guide students in their educational journey. This project combines machine learning with web technologies to provide personalized learning recommendations, career guidance, and interactive educational resources. It aims to create a user-friendly environment for students to explore, learn, and grow in the field of technology.

## 🚀 Features
- **Personalized Learning Recommendation**: Uses machine learning algorithms to suggest courses and resources based on user input.
- **Career Path Predictor**: Helps students choose the right career track using AI predictions.
- **Interactive Frontend**: Clean and responsive user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend with Django**: Handles AI model predictions, user data management, and API integrations.
- **AI & Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes classification/regression algorithms to predict suitable learning paths and resources.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays insightful data and recommendations with charts and graphs.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout with Bootstrap 5.x to ensure seamless access across all devices.

## 🧰 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- **Backend**: Django (Python Framework)
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (for production)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn (classification models), joblib (model serialization)
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn, WhiteNoise (for static files), optional Docker setup

## ⚙️ Project Requirements

### Backend:
- Python >= 3.10
- Django >= 4.x
- NumPy >= 1.21.0
- scikit-learn >= 1.1.0
- joblib >= 1.2.0

### Frontend:
- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- Bootstrap 5.x (optional)

### Deployment:
- Gunicorn >= 20.0.0
- WhiteNoise >= 5.3.0

## 📌 How It Works
1. **User Interaction**: Students interact with the web application via a simple form interface.
2. **Data Processing**: The input is processed on the backend and passed to a trained machine learning model.
3. **AI Prediction**: The model predicts the best learning track or career option based on student responses.
4. **Result Display**: Recommendations, resources, and career suggestions are displayed with interactive visuals.
